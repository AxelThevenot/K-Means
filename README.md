## K-Means principle

![5-means example](src/5_means.gif)

## K-Means application



## Pseudo Code

Gradient descent method for logistic regression

```

```

## Let's start with python for the k-means algorithm

### Import

```python
```

### Variables

As usual I made a region to change the variables to an easier understanding. Variables that can be manually changed are those, which are in uppercases. They are classed as variables for : 
* 
* 
* 

```python

```

### Load dataset


```python

```

### K-means algorithm


```python

```


```python

```




```python

```

### Display



```python

```

```python

```

Finally, implement the `key_pressed()` function to activate the algorithm when Enter key is pressed.

```python
def key_pressed(event):
    """
    To start to run the programme by enter key
    :param event: key_press_event
    """
    if event.key == 'enter':
        global started
        started = not started
```
### Run it ! 

```python
```

## Let's start with python for the elbow method



### Elbow method

```python

```

### Display



```python

### Run it !
